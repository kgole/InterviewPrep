- Stores Data in form of key:value pairs.
- Readability of data is faster and easier as compared to other datasets.
- time compexity is O(1).
- In Hash Functions once data is assigned to a key, you can not update the key. Key is immutable.
- Example:

[2,5,3] : nums ----this is incorrect as arrays are mutable
we can convert it to tuple which are immutable,
tuple([2,5,3]) : nums  ---- this is corrrect. 

- To retrieve data from Hashmaps we can use below functions,

Hashmap.keys() -  gives all keys
Hashmap.values() - gives all values
Hashmap.items() - comibination of keys and values.
